\abstract{
A critical area of DBMS systems is the concurrency model. DBMS systems often handle large volumes of transactions in short intervals. Concurrency models are key here in handling such volumes. Concurrency also exposes the DBMS system to vulnerabilities to its durability and integrity. One point of vulnerability is the effect of the scheduling of operations and transactions on database integrity. The author in this paper explores how model checking may be used as a technology to verify the design assumptions in database concurrency model design. Two Phase Locking (2PL) will be used as an existing standard to compare results.}
