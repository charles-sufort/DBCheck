In the design and operation of DBMS systems, enforcing the ACID properties of the system is of critical importance \cite{textbook}. This in turn implies the importance of having effective methods to test and measure a system's observance of ACID properties. Formal methods are one approach to building systems with secure designs. Model checking is an example of a formal method with the capacity to test design concepts. 

Temporal Logic Model Checking is a one variant with major application in verification and validation of both software and hardware systems. Examples of successful verification of industrial systems include the PCI Local Bus, an aircraft controller and a medical monitoring system \cite{McMillian1993}. In particular, these examples have made used of the Symbolic Model Verifier (SMV). The technology used in this application is NuSMV, which is a variant based off of SMV. These technologies use temporal model checking, which is one form of model checking where there exists efficient algorithms.

In temporal logic model checking, the model checker accepts a model specification and specifications written in temporal logic. It in turn checks the validity of these specifications and furnishes counter examples if there are any. Due to the capacity for temporal logic to express propertiecs involving timing conditions, concurency systems are a natural domain for this form of model checking \cite{temporal}.
