\section{CTL}
CTL or Computational Temporal Logic is a variant of temporal logic which explores the truth of states in regard to the future paths from  a given state. In NuSMV, this would be the initial state of the model. The language itself consists of a number of quantifiers and atomic propositions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item EG - Exists Globally
\item EX - exists Next
\item EF - exists finally
\item AG - For all Globally
\item AX - for all next
\item AF - for all finally
\end{enumerate}
The atomic propositions in NuSMV will correspond to the values of the variables  and module which make up the model.
