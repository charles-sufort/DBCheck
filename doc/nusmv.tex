\section{NuSMV}
The technology used in the model checking analysis is the NuSMV symbolic model checker. NuSMV works by defining the model of a state machine. This is in effect a transition system with a number of states and rules which determine the transitioning between states. NuSMV allows for the definition of objects or modules with basic data structures and operations. The model checking of these model workings by testing specifications against the models to determine the truth or falsity of the specifications for the models. The specification languages used are LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) and CTL (Computational Tree Logic). For the purposes of the author, only CTL was required.
